# snakeAI
Collection of scripts in my project to build the game Snake and then apply a generational algorithm to train a neural network to play it.

The file 'gamebuild' is the user-interactive game.
The file 'hardcoded' is the hardcoded algorithm to play the game, to use as a benchmark for the AI.
The file 'TFML' is the AI training using a generational algorithm, built using TensorFlow.
